I just started developing Orango at the start of August 2018 and have been working on getting functionality in place. Some documentation will be provided at the start (mostly as examples). There is a lot of documentation to be done and I will be steadily working on it, so please visit this site often for updates. Below is the current roadmap I have planned out:

### Features
* autoIndex in schema - will create indexes as properties become part of query
* Getter / Setters in schema
* Events
* Pre / Post Interceptors
* Support upsert option

### Fixes
* Check / Change name that references setDefaultsToNull, API change needed - withDefaults option, etc
* Fix up for loops to be async
* Break out Tang into separate repo
* filterToAQL array support

### Other
* unit tests (in progress) - 100+ and counting
* cleanup
* more documentation
* web browser compatible
* create document website for orangojs.com
* add lint
* Better error handler / dispatching
